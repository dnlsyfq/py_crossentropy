# Cross Entropy
Cross Entropy Example , Case 

**Maximizing Probabilities**

Better model yields better probabilities, but how do we maximise or increase probability ? Does  by minimising error function will
take us to best solution ?

> maximising probabilities == minimising error ? Maybe ? 

connection between probabilities and error functions, and it's called Cross-Entropy. 
How likely events happens based on the Probabilities. If likely , low entropy and unlikely high entropy
